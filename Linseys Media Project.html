In such cases, the annoying trait is no secret, but people fail to appreciate how their judgments of it will change with time. Importantly, such fatal qualities are often different from one's own; they may seem admirable and desirable at first-so that a spendthrift who's always broke may initially admire a tightwad who counts every penny--but over time people realize that such opposites aren't attractive (Rick et al., 2011).

Maureen is the ‘wild’ one and Joanne is the ‘uptight’ one.

More often than we realize (Keysar &amp; Henly, 2002), we face an interpersonal gap in which the sender's intentions differ from the effect on the receiver. (p. 142)

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p><strong>Explination</strong>:</p><p>This song is a story about two people who have different interpretations of the word bitch and how it causes conflict in the future. The young man recalls his mother singing a song and referencing herself as a ‘bad bitch.’ Since his mother referenced herself as a ‘bad bitch’ he takes it to mean more a less a strong woman. On the other hand, a young girl watched a music video where the rapper mentions ‘bad bitches’ and had number of provocative women surrounding him so she took the term ‘bad bitches’ to mean be provocative. When the boy and girl meet in the future they have a conflict of understanding because they have different views on the meaning of ‘bad bitch.’

People who are intimate with each other act differently toward one another than acquaintances do, and dominant, high-status people act differently than subordinates do. (p. 143)

There seem to be a language barrier between them but through nonverbal communication the singer knows what the woman is looking for. Repeatedly throughout the song she mentions the women placing her hands around her waist - a very intimate gesture – and trying to pull her closer. The singer continues to rebuff her advances. She’s willing to spend time with the woman but has no interest in any type of romantic relationship.

and help dispel, rather than perpetuate, their partners' bad moods. That's usually good for the relationship. Such behavior may involve considerable self- restraint, but it is not motivated by weakness; instead, accommodation often involves a conscious effort to protect the partnership from harm.

She is willing to let her partner go and venture out because she knows that she’s the only one that could love her like she deserves. This is obviously a very destructive choice. She is willing to put herself through the agony of being cheated on just so she can maintain the relationship with her partner.
