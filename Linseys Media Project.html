This song shows how two people in a close relationship can have conflicting interest and how the conflict causes distress in the relationship. Max just wants to be at home and Goofy wants to go on a road trip. Since Max doesn’t want to be there then it basically ruins Goofy’s excitement for a father son trip. (Authors note: The Goofy Movie is my favorite movie and this is that only way I could get at least one of its songs into the project.)

It’s generally harder to be rejected dented you the rejecting, and anyone who mopes and dwells on what they’ve lost and how lousy they feel during a break up is likely to have a hard time; rumination prolongs our distress, whereas reflection-- seeking meaning in her experiences and looking to learn from them – is associated with positive adjustment in recovery."

In the beginning, she talks about being afraid of being without him. Then after repeated nights of pondering all his negative actions she gained the strength to move on. When she used to think about him she got more and more depressed but soon once she reflected on their relationship she could move on.
