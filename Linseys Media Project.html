“We rely on our partners for emotional support in the form of affection, acceptance, and reassurance; physical comfort in the form of hugs and cuddling; advice support in the form of information and guidance; and material support, or tangible assistance in the form of money or goods.” (Miller, 2015, p.216)
</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p><strong>Explination: 
</strong></p><p>Even though the song doesn’t really mention any type of emotional support you can tell by his voice that he truly does have an affection towards his friend. The song does on the other hand mention giving material support. The first thing he says is that he would give them the biggest gift at a party and the second thing is he said he would buy them a Cadillac if they needed a car.  These are obvious forms of tangible assistance.

</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p><strong>Explination</strong>:</p><p>In this song, the singer is begging for God to find him somebody to love. He is a lonely man and emotionally isolation is destroying him. He is experiencing problems physically (e.g. trouble standing) and emotionally (e.g. constant crying). He’s also experiencing social isolation because his friends think he’s crazy so he doesn’t feel like he can count on them. This song shows how the stress of loneliness can take a toll on one’s body and mind.

These actions can take various forms (DeGue &amp; DiLillo, 2005). The type of pressure that is applied can range from (a) mildly coercive verbal persuasion (that may involve false promises, guilt induction, or threats to end the relationship); to (b) plying someone with alcohol or drugs to weaken his or her resistance.” (Miller, 2015, p.304)
